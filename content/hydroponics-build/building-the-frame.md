We spent a lot of time thinking through all of the constraints needed to build
the hydroponics wall. Of these, there were a few that had to be made in advanced
so that you can build the frame around it.

### Available space
It's important not to just look into floor space availability, but also how high
you are able to build the frame. In our case, we only have the space inside of
our garage near our garage door. We had to take the height measurements with the
garage-door opened. The lowest point, with the garage door in the open position
was 85 inches. All of our calculations had to start there.

We also had a large enough space for something that is about 2 feet by 4 feet,
but there's enough wiggle room here that we decided to make our garden a little
wider and a little deeper. It ended up being 26 inches x 52 inches.

### Vertical or horizontal
Although we have a longer write-up on our decision regarding [vertical versus
horizontal NFT hydroponics build](
{{< ref "/general-hydroponics/vertical-versus-horizontal-layout.md" >}})

### Size your reservoir
Since this is an NFT, nutrient film technique, build, all of the growing sites
will need to be above the tank. So deciding on how big your reservoir is and
its dimensions. Your frame will need to accommodate for these dimensions,
particularly the height, since that is the minimum height where you can actually
grow your plants.

### Grow sites spacing
You will have to consider both the number of avaialble sites and the spacing
between the sites. For us, since we wanted to aim for slightly larger spacing
than what we have on our Aerogarden, that was the limiting factor for us. Given
the "wall space" of our location, we can only accommodate about 60 sites that
are 7 inches apart.

### Mobility
Does your hydroponics garden have to be mobile? Since ours is in our already
cluttered garage, it needed to be mobile so we can get to our tools on the
walls. This took away several inches, but gave us a little more flexibility on
the location day-to-day, project-by-project depending on our needs for the
garage space.

##### Light and easy to move around
Under this same category is the ability to move the frame around when it is
unloaded. It was something that we needed given the limited space in our garage,
especially when we have to clean things up. Given this, the frame we built, when
unloaded of all the hydropnics stuff, is pretty light and can be moved around.
It is a bit big and awkward, but the caster wheels help with that tremendously.

### Temperature
